### Reflection: 
- As we know it, during the early stages of career exploration, many individuals, including myself, struggle with uncertainty about which career path to pursue or how to achieve long-term goals. 

- By doing this module, I learnt that the goal is to create a structured Career Development Plan to clarify personal aspirations, strengths and actions needed to reach career milestones. 

- The concept of SMART goals was introduced in this module. It guided us to reflect on personal values, strengths, and interests and to envision where we want to be on one to three years. The steps included defining career goals, identifying required skills and experience as well as using models like the 70/20/10 learning framework to create an actionable plan.

- Through this process, a realistic, structured career pathway was developed and by aligning goals with personal values and available opportunities, I gained clarity, increased motivation, and the ability to track my progress toward meaningful employment outcomes.

### Evidence:

### Reflection:
- After learning the topic about Skills and Interests, I've realised that many individuals enter career fields that do not align with their core values or interests, which leads to dissatisfaction, disengagement, or even burnout in the workplace. This was the situation that led me to evaluate whether my career direction matched my values and interests

- I had to discover what kinds or tasks energize and fulfil me, rather than just what I'm capable of doing and i could do that with the help of this module. I discovered that my core values include creativity, independence, and helping others which meant my interests fell under the Artistic, Social and Enterprising categories.

- The action i took was to complete the skills self-assessment, identifying transferable and adaptive skills like problem-solving, communication, and leadership.

- This led to me having a clearer understanding of the types of work environments, tasks, and job roles that are most suitable for me. I now realised that, by matching interests and skills with potential career paths, individuals can pursue careers that are not only achievable but also enjoyable.

### Reflection:
- During this module, i learnt that a common challenge in professional development in the mismatch between and individual's personality traits and the organizational culture, which can hinder performance and satisfaction. While doing a group assignment, I noticed that while i contributed good ideas, I often clashed with my group members on how to execute them.

- As discussed in this topic, you need to evaluate personality traits using a structured framework to identify compatible career paths and work environments, so that is exactly what I did. I used the personality assessment tools provided in the module which revealed that i thrive in leadership and creative roles, but I need to be mindful of how assertiveness can come across to others.

- This topic provided individuals with insights into roles and environments that align with their characteristics, so as a result, my group work improved significantly, and I was more effective in both collaboration and leadership. Understanding my personality didn't just help with teamwork, it also gave me clarity about the environments and roles I'm best suited for.

## Create a CV
### Evidence:

### Reflection:
- Job applicants often fail to secure interviews, not due to a lack of qualifications, but because their CV's are not professionally structured to highlight their strengths. This situation made me realise that my CV was not effectively showcasing my value to employers.

- I was tasked to improve my CV so that it reflected the necessary and correct information, such as my unique skills, experiences, and alignment with employer expectations. Appling the CV-enhancement principles from the module, I concentrated on viewing my CV as a marketing tool rather than just a list of responsibilities. 

- The work-readiness module taught best practices for CV creation, including the organization of key sections such as contact information, education, work experience, and skills, as well as optional sections like a personal summary. My actions included tailoring each section of my CV using action verbs. I also added a profile statement as well as a skills section based on my adaptive and technical capabilities.

- The module taught me that a CV should communicate not only qualifications, but also personal value and relevance to the role. My CV is now professionally formatted and content-rich which demonstrates relevance and attention to detail.

### Reflection:
- After gaining all the knowledge I need to know about crafting a professional and well-structured CV, I've learnt that even a well-crafted CV can be overlooked if submitted incorrectly, with errors in formatting, email etiquette, or timing, leading to missed opportunities. 

- My task was to ensure that my CV submission met professional standards. both in format and delivery and ensuring it reflects technical and soft skills. I then referred back to the module's lesson on email etiquette and asynchronous communication.

- This module provided me with detailed instructions on email etiquette, file formatting, and professional communication. I then wrote a concise, respectful email with a clear subject line, attaching a well-structured PDF version of my CV, as well as ending it with a professional signature and a follow-up note. 

- I learnt from this module that, by submitting a CV with a professional tone and the correct format, it enhances the overall impression on employers and by doing this, the result was that it gave me more confidence in digital communications. This task emphasized the importance of not just what you send, but how you send it.
